TSTabView
=======

`TSTabView` UI component that allows to flip left and right through pages of data. Pages content provided to TSTabView by implementing TSTabViewDataSource protocol. TSTabView can manage set of UIView or UIViewController objects. TSNavigationStripView control is used to display available pages titles/tabs and navigate between them.
Custom TSNavigationStripView entity should be provided to TSTabView during initialisation. Some features are listed below:

* Navigates through set of UIView or UIViewController objects.
* Support far jumps between pages.
* Tabs list in TSNavigationStripView support different types of layout and alignment, including: alignment to left side, alignment to right side, autofill available space, central alignment (which imitate behaviour of ViewPager component on Android).
* Tabs list in TSNavigationStripView can be scrollable.
* TSNavigationStripView can display additional menu items on left or right sides.
* TSNavigationStripView provide great flexibility for appearance  customisation.
* All view transitions are done with smooth animations.

Example of TSTabView object instantiation provided below.
```
TSNavigationStripView *navigationStripView = [[TSNavigationStripView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width, 32)];
// Customize navigation view appearance...

TSTabView *tabView = [[TSTabView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds navigationMenu:navigationStripView];
tabView.delegate = self;
[self.view addSubview: tabView];

TSTabViewModel *tabViewModel = [[TSTabViewModel alloc] initWithTabView:tabView];
[tabViewModel setTabs:@[
	[[TSTabViewSection alloc] initWithTitle:@"Tab 1" andView: /* Provide view */],
	[[TSTabViewSection alloc] initWithTitle:@"Tab 2" andView: /* Provide view */]]
];
```

## TSNavigationStripView

`TSNavigationStripView` is a navigation menu control with highly customizable design and flexible structure.
It provides smooth animations for item selection and dynamic content modification. Some features are listed below:

* Display set of section titles (tabs).
* Select section (tab) from list.
* Scroll between sections (tabs).
* Left and right navigation buttons on sides.
* Fully customized appearance (see examples).
* Support different types of layout and alignment: alignment to left side, alignment to right side, autofill available space, central alignment (which imitate behaviour of ViewPager component on Android).
* Additinal not scrolled menu items can be added on left and right sides.

* Parent repository [TSUIKit](https://github.com/Viacheslav-Radchenko/TSUIKit).
* Demo video [TSTabView](http://youtu.be/GvTfKJM43uQ).

## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC
* QuartzCore.framework

## Demo

Build and run the `TSTabView ` project in Xcode to see examples of each component.
Right now better way to see components functionality is to compile examples provided with project, they fully display structure and dynamics of controls, as well as possible use cases.

## Installation

The easiest way to integrate TSUIKit is using CocoaPods. Just add this to your Podfile:
```
	pod 'TSUIKit', '~> 0.1' 
```

Other option is to  drop source files from `Classes\TSUIKit` folder into your project and add corresponding `#include "*.h"` to the top of classes that will use particular component.
`TS*Models` are optional part of `TSTabView` infrastructure. They provide ready-to-use examples of corresponding data source implementations. You may use them or implement your own data sources.
`TSTabView` use `QuartzCore.framework`, so you might need to add it as well.
