## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC
* QuartzCore.framework

## Demo

Build and run the `TSTabView ` project in Xcode to see examples of each component.
Right now better way to see components functionality is to compile examples provided with project, they fully display structure and dynamics of controls, as well as possible use cases.

## Installation

All you need to do is drop source files from `Classes\TSUIKit` folder into your project and add corresponding `#include "*.h"` to the top of classes that will use particular component.
`TS*Models` are optional part of `TSTabView` infrastructure. They provide ready-to-use examples of corresponding data source implementations. You may use them or implement your own data sources.
`TSTabView` use `QuartzCore.framework`, so you might need to add it as well.
